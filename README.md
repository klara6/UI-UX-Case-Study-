This case study presents a full redesign of the Goodreads mobile app, covering the complete user flow. It aims to improve long-term user engagement, modernise the product to remain competitive, and introduce new features without increasing cognitive load or fragmenting user experience. 

The project involved industry-standard tools for UI/UX and Product design, including Figma, FigJam, Notion, Figma Smart Animate, Miro, and React.

My design strategy centered on resolving critical usability gaps within the Goodreads mobile experience. Key focus areas included simplifying navigation structures, improving content discoverability, and establishing a more cohesive visual hierarchy. These improvements were designed to enhance overall usability while respecting the platform's existing value proposition.

User research informed every stage of the UX process. I gathered qualitative insights to uncover friction points, unmet needs, and feature expectations. These findings guided prioritization decisions and ensured that design solutions, including the introduction of new features, were grounded in real user behavior rather than assumptions. 

Using the Double Diamond design process, I approached this project through four structured phases: Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver.
